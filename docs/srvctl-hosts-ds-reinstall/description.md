This command reinstalls an operating system for the selected dedicated server. The `-i`, `--input` allows to provide parameters of a created server in a local file. Parameters should be described as a request body of the [Public API request](https://developers.servers.com/api-documentation/v1/#tag/Dedicated-Server/operation/CreateADedicatedServer).

There is also an option to use standard input (stdin) when specifying the flag this way: `--input -`
